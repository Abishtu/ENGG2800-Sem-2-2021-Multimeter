So far for the electrical side. We have developed measuring circuits for all parts of the multimeter. These circuits are taking output voltages and these output voltages are then used in conjunction with the known circuit elements to find our input voltage. Similarly, with the resistance, everything is known except one resistor. This resistor causes a voltage drop and thus allows us to calculate the unknown resistance, given the known values. We must also note, that these values will all return voltages and the calculations will be managed internally through software. The voltage before interacting with the ADC or microcontroller, will need to be scaled down and shifted so that we are only assessing voltages in a range safe enough for the ADC, and therefore the voltages will be calculated inetrnally through the software. This eliminates error and ensures the components are not damaged (as hgiher voltages above VDD and below V GND will cause issues in the circuit).
